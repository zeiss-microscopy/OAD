## Machine Learning versus Deep Learning

The difference between those can be easily explained in a single sentence: Deep Learning is a special subset of general Machine learning, which is again a subset of Artificial Intelligence.
Therefore DeepLearning obviously is Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms are Machine Learning algorithms.

<p><img src="./images/ML_general-DeepLearning.png" title="Artificial Intelligence - Machine learning - Deep Learning" width="400"></p>

- Machine learning gives computers the ability to learn without being programmed explicitly for a specific task
- Two main categories exist: Supervised and Unsupervised methods

Deep learning itself consists of methods to analyze data using an approach that mimics the way a person would try to make sense of it. Deep Learning methods use a layered structure of algorithms called an artificial neural networks (ANN).

<p><img src="./images/ML_general-Neural%20Network.png" title="General Structure of a very simple neural network" width="400"></p>

ANNs have an input layer and obviously an output layer. The layers between are so-called hidden layers, which means their values cannot be observed (easily) during the training. An ANN gets "deeper" if the number of hidden layers increases.

- Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning
- Deep Learning is using "layered" algorithms called ANN

## Main differences between Deep Learning and Machine Learning

There are three major general differences (simplified:)

- typically Machine learning algorithms are rather" simple" compared to ANNs
- Deep Learning methods extract features automatically and learn what features work best
- classical Machine Learning methods are using features typically "engineered" by human intervention
- Deep Learning typically requires a lot more data due to the complex algorithms used

## ZEN and APEER Machine Learning - Overview

The sketch below outlines "the bigger" picture and vision and will be updated frequently. The most important points to consider here are:

- the “exchange” currency inside this ecosystem is the trained model
- the the open-source python package [czmodel] allows everybody to import their own models in ZEN or vision4D
- skilled researchers and programmers can train their own models where the like and still deploy them for "their" users in ZEN or vision4D or on the [APEER-ML] platform
- one can get pre-trained models from ZEISS or get a trained model **as a service** (includes the label process)
- on the [APEER-ML] platform it is possible to label your own data, train model and download it as *.czann file to be used in ZEN or vision4D

## Feature Extraction

Intellesis Segmentation supports two different ways of segmenting an image:

- Feature Extraction with engineered feature sets followed by PixelClassification using a RandomForrest classifier
- Use Deep Neural networks for segmentation.
- for detailed information please see: [Feature Extractors](../Machine_Learning/Feature_Extractors/feature_extractors.md)
- the following lines always refer to the RandomForest classifier only.

### What Implementation of the RandomForest is used by Intellesis

- Intellesis is using the following open.source implentation: [scikit-learn - Random Forest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html#sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier)
- except for the number of estimators (= 25) Intellesis used the default values

### How does a RandomForest Classifier work

- Each decision tree in the forest considers a subset of features when forming “questions” and only has access to a subset set of the training data
- this increases diversity in the forest leading to more robust overall predictions and the name ‘Random Forest.’ 
- **Prediction** = average of all the individual decision tree estimates
- Regression task = predicting a continuous value of …
- **Classification task** = predict discrete class labels such as A or B
- Random Forest will take a **majority vote** for the predicted class

## Application Examples

ZEN can basically read any image data format using the BioFormats Import and Intellesis can therefore be used to segment **any multi-dimensional data set** that can be imported into the software. Shown below are images segmented using ZEN Intellesis Trainable Segmentation.

## General Workflows for Intellesis Segmentation in ZEN

![Intellesis - Workflows](../Images/intellesis_workflows.png "Intellesis - Workflows")

---

### How to train a simple Pixel Classifier for Segmentation Intellesis

Training pixel classifier in Intellesis is very simple and just requires the following steps:

1. Create a new model and start the training UI.
2. Import one (or more) training images in order to label them.
3. Make up your mind if one wants to train on a single channel only or by using a spectral information.
4. Label cell nuclei and background.
5. Press Train & Segment and check the results.
6. Go back to 4. and label where the segmentation is not correct.
7. Press Finish when done to save the trained model.

> **IMPORTANT**: If a model was trained one a single channel only it can be used to segment single channel images only. If all channels where used during the training the model can be only use to segment images with a "matching" channel number.

Watch the short videos below to see those steps in action:

![Intellesis - Train a model to segment a cell using a single channel](../Images/zenblue_simple_nucleus_segmentation_single_channel.gif) **Intellesis - Train a model to segment a cell using a single channel**

![Intellesis - Train a model to segment a cell using all channels (multispectral](../Images/zenblue_simple_nucleus_segmentation_multispectral.gif) **Intellesis - Train a model to segment a cell using all channels (multispectral)**

---

### How to use a model (trained on a single channel) inside an Image Analysis pipeline

Once the model is trained it can be directly used inside an Image Analysis pipeline as part of the segmentation step. sThe required steps are:

1. Create a new Image analysis setting.
2. Define the class names, for "all the objects" and for the **single objects** and choose a color.
3. Assign the correct channel to the class **single objects**
4. Inside the segmentation step use the **Select** button to choose the segmentation method **Intellesis Trainable Class Segmenter**.
5. Select you model one just trained.
6. Select the class of interest, eg. the **nuclei**.
7. Check the segmentation preview and modify additional post-processing parameters, eg. filter out small objects.
8. Define the features to be measure and pre-configure a simple visualization of the results (can be modified later still).
9. Press **Finish** to save the setting and now use **Analyze** to run the image analysis.
10. Inspect the results.

> **IMPORTANT**: It is crucial to understand that a model trained on a single channel have to be assigned to the respective objects that should be segmented with the model. This very flexible approach allows to segment different structures using individual models or classical segmentation approached also inside hierarchical objects structures (with sub-objects etc).

Watch the short video below to see those steps in action.

![Intellesis - Use a trained model for segmentation inside an Image Analysis Setting](../Images/zenblue_use_simple_nucleus_single_channel_segmentation_in_IA.gif) **Intellesis - Use a trained model for segmentation inside an Image Analysis Setting**

---

### How to use a model (trained on all channels) inside an Image Analysis pipeline

If the model was trained on all channels of an image it can be directly used to create an image analysis setting with a pre-defined class structure. The required steps are:

1. Right-Click on the model and press **Create Image Analysis Setting**.
2. Enter the desired name for the setting.
3. Open the newly created Image Analysis setting (based on the class structure of the trained model). There is no need to assign any classes etc. since this is derived from the model directly.
4. Check the segmentation preview and modify additional post-processing parameters, eg. filter out small objects.
5. Define the features to be measure and pre-configure a simple visualization of the results (can be modified later still).
6. Press **Finish** to save the setting and now use **Analyze** to run the image analysis.
7. Inspect the results.

> **IMPORTANT**: The very simple and fast way to create an Image Analysis setting directly from model trained on multiple channels ahs the benefit of being able to use it directly without the need to setup classes. The limitation on the other side is that the object class structure is fixed (1:1 match between classes inside the trained model and classes for the image analysis). Therefore the limitation is that the class structure of the image analysis can not be modified nor it is possible to deal with sub-objects etc.

Watch the short video below to see those steps in action.

## Bringing CZANNs and ZEISS software ecosystem together

Training artificial neural networks (ANN) to tackle semantic segmentation problems has become a very popular task and an increasing number of solutions has become available that require little technical understanding to train ANNs. Of course, this statement does not hold for models highly optimized for specific use cases where solving the problem at hand requires a high amount of experience, creativity and some “magic”. However, in many cases it is possible to achieve decent results with widely used ANN model architectures, a sufficient amount of data and enough compute power.

While about a decade ago solving computer vision tasks required an expert to design algorithms and understand the math behind them, ANNs and simple-to-use frameworks like [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) allow learning those algorithms from data and therefore can be treated as a black-box even achieving super-human performance in some cases. This simplicity and the high expressiveness of neural network models are presumably the reason that ANNs have become extremely popular and there is literally no way around this technology in research as well as industry. It should, however, be mentioned here that it is still extremely helpful to understand what happens behind the scenes.

### The challenges of deployment

While in research the focus mostly lies on training and evaluating models, deployment is a different issue that poses different challenges. Especially in microscopy there usually are not only captured small images but stacks of images, time series of images or tiled scenes that are stitched to one large image of multiple or even hundreds of gigabytes. The training process, in contrast, is typically performed on small image crops (e.g. 256 x 256) such that the data for the calculations fits into the GPU or main memory of the employed machine. Applying a trained model on considerably larger images as mentioned above brings about several pitfalls that need to be handled.

The [ZEN Intellesis](https://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/int/products/microscope-software/zen-intellesis-image-segmentation-by-deep-learning.html) infrastructure provides a solution for that problem. It applies a sophisticated tiling strategy that transforms multi-dimensional image captures – as they are generated by ZEISS microscopes – to image tiles of shape (height x width x color channels) where height and width are defined by the applied ANN model. Finally, it performs inference with the model and reassembles the resulting segmentation masks to fit the initially captured image. It therefore offers a solution to apply a trained ANN on large images without worrying too much about the required memory and the size of the image.

### The czmodel PyPi package

Starting with ZEN Blue 3.2 it will be possible to run prediction with custom segmentation models trained "outside of ZEN". To be compatible with the Intellesis infrastructure, a model has to comply with our specification and some meta data must be provided that is described in detail in the official CZANN model specification in the project description of our [czmodel package](https://pypi.org/project/czmodel/).

For a simple example of such a pipeline see the attached Jupyter notebook (ready to be executed) in our [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/zeiss-microscopy/OAD/blob/master/Machine_Learning/notebooks/czmodel/SingleClassSemanticSegmentation_4_0_0.ipynb). Note that the notebook is not to be understood as a best practice guide for training ANN models but rather illustrates the use of the [czmodel](https://pypi.org/project/czmodel/) library with a very simple model generation process that will usually be more sophisticated.

![Importing External Networks](../Machine_Learning/images/czmodel_pypi.png)


## Importing a CZMODEL into ZEN blue or ZEN core

It is possible to export and import import \*.czmodel files, which contain the trained segmentation model, in ZEN blue and in ZEN core.

### How to import a model in ZEN

To Import a model in ZEN use the **Import** model function inside ZEN blue or ZEN core.

<p><img src="../Images/zen32_model_import_dialog.png" title="ZEN blue - Import Model" width="600"></p>

<p><img src="../Images/zen32_model_import_file.png" title="ZEN blue - Select CZMODEL or JSON file" width="600"></p>

<p><img src="../Images/zen_core30_model_import.png" title="ZEN core - Select CZMODEL or JSON file" width="600"></p>

---


### How to create external models

Starting with ZEN blue 3.2 and ZEN core 3.1 it will be possible to import externally trained models into ZEN. To import such a file just use the normal import function mentioned above. The general idea here is:

- **the ZEISS Custom Solution Team, a researcher or any 3rd party trains its specific neural network**
- the PyPi package [czmodel](https://pypi.org/project/czmodel/) is used to convert and package the model as a *.czann file
- the *.czann file is imported into ZEN using the normal **Import** mechanisms

From here on the network can be used inside the ZEN Image Analysis, Processing functions, BioApps, Material Modules and also inside [Guided Acquisition Workflows](https://github.com/zeiss-microscopy/OAD/tree/master/Guided_Acquisition)

---

### Intellesis Segmentation - Scripting Integration

Most functions regarding Intellesis Segmentation can be scripted via Python in ZEN in order to automate and customize workflows. Check out the [scripts](../Machine_Learning/scripts/README.md) for some simple examples.

```python
def classify(image, model,
             use_confidence=True,
             confidence_threshold=0,
             format=ZenSegmentationFormat.MultiChannel):

    # classify pixels using a trained model
    if use_confidence:
        try:
            # run the segmentation and apply confidence threshold to segmented image
            outputs = Zen.Processing.Segmentation.TrainableSegmentationWithProbabilityMap(image, model, segf)
            seg_image = outputs[0]
            prop_map = outputs[1]
            seg_image = Zen.Processing.Segmentation.MinimumConfidence(seg_image, prop_map, confidence_threshold)
            prop_map.Close()
            del outputs
        except ApplicationException as e:
            seg_image = None
            print('Application Exception : '), e.Message

    if not use_confidence:
        try:
            # run the segmentation
            seg_image = Zen.Processing.Segmentation.TrainableSegmentation(image, model, segf)
        except ApplicationException as e:
            seg_image = None
            print('Application Exception : '), e.Message

    return seg_image
```

### Example Networks - Conditions of Use

_These pre-trained networks were trained with "best-effort" on the available training data and is (are) provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. The licensor assumes no responsibility for the functionality and fault-free condition of the pre-trained network under conditions which are not in the described scope. Be aware that no pre-trained network will perform equally good on any sample, especially not on samples it was not trained for. Therefore, use such pre-trained networks at your own risks and it is up to the user to evaluate and decide if the obtained segmentation results are valid for the images currently segmented using such a network. For details see the respective chapter in the Online Help / Documentation. By downloading and using the networks I agree to the above terms._

## Integrated Workflows using trained models

### Use Nucleus Detector inside a Zone-of-Influence workflow

Once an externally trained model is imported (or was trained in ZEN) it can be plugged into any ZEN image analysis pipeline using a feature called **Class Segmentation**. The general idea is to set up a measurement hierarchy for the objects and the plugin trained models were needed, for example to robustly detect stained cell nuclei.

This approach also allows to mix machine-learning based segmentation with classical methods like "simple" threshold approaches. As an example, the robust nucleus detection using a pre-trained network is an ideal segmentation method to be used to segment the \*\*Primary Objects" inside a so-called "Zone-of-Influence" segmentation as shown below

1. Plugin the imported model into the class **Primary Objects** to robustly detect the stained cell nuclei inside a specific channel
2. Use this primary object to define a **Ring** around every detect cell nucleus
3. Define further subclasses as needed and segment them using other ML models or by applying an automated threshold
4. Run the complete image analysis pipeline incl. the model execution without having to worry about tile sizes, patches etc. and visualize the results easily

# ZEN Intellesis Denoising

Starting with ZEN blue 3.6 and ZEN core 3.4 it is possible to train and use AI-powered denoising methods inside the ZEN software. The algorithm used is called Noise2Void (N2V) and is described in the paper [Noise2Void - Learning Denoising from Single Noisy Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10980).

## The algorithm

The denoising module in ZEN uses the Noise2Void (N2V) approach and has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance at denoising scientific images. Because N2V is a general-purpose algorithm that does not require prior knowledge of the specific noise distribution, it is ideal to denoise wide range of microscopy image modalities, including fluorescence microscopy, bright-field microscopy, and electron microscopy.

## What is Noise (inside images in microscopy)

Sidenote: Parts of the text and images are taken from this publication: [Imaging in focus: An introduction to denoising bioimages in the era of deep learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357272521001588)


Whenever one is imaging an object it is crucial to recognize that:

**_"Every image is an imperfect representation of the underlying structure that is being imaged!"_**

### Reasons for “Imperfection"

- Limited resolution because of the optics
- Uneven illumination or background
- Unwanted stray light or out-of-focus light
- Image artifacts
- **Noise**

![ZEN Denoising](../Machine_Learning/images/denoise2.png)**Image Imperfections**

All of the things above are "unwanted" but it is important to understand that methods like N2V can only help with the noise itself not with all the other undesired things in your image. 

### Main sources of Noise in microscopy

- Shot Noise (due to the nature of light itself, Poisson Distribution)
- Detector Noise (due to the electronics etc., models as additive Gaussian noise)

### What is Noise2Void (simplified):

- it is a deep-learning based method to learn “the noise” from the image itself (no labels or ground truth need) in order to remove the noise
- by “masking” a pixel (hiding it from the receptive field of the Deep Neural Network
- Assumption when using N2V: pixel-independent noise or so called "iid" (identically distributed samples)noise, which depends on detection method and the used detectors itself


### What pure Noise2Void cannot do:

- remove out-of-focus or stray light or background signal
- increase the resolution
- correct uneven illumination
- correct image artifact

## Understanding the training parameters

The Intellesis Denoising training interface shares a resemblance with the Intellesis machine learning training interface, making it user-friendly for both new and existing users to develop personalized denoising models. This training interface features four adjustable parameters, namely the number of epochs, batch size, window size, and masking ratio. While the default values may suffice, users may need to lower the batch size when using a resource-limited system (e.g., your work laptop). Further details on each of these parameters are available below.

### Number of epochs:

The "number of epochs" refers to the number of times the training dataset is passed through the neural network during the training process. Each pass through the dataset is called an epoch. (an epoch consists of a fixed number of samples drawn from the dataset) In N2V, the number of epochs is a user-defined parameter that determines how many times the neural network will be trained on the full dataset. If the number of epochs is too short, the model may not be able to learn the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in underfitting. On the other hand, if the number of epochs is too long, the model may start to memorize the training data, resulting in overfitting making it less effective at denoising new images. 


### Batch size:

The "batch size" refers to the number of samples (image patches) that are processed by the neural network at once. During each epoch, the training dataset is typically divided into several smaller batches, and the neural network is updated based on the average loss across the batch. The batch size is another user-defined parameter that controls how many samples are processed in each batch. If the batch size is too small, the model may converge slowly and can result in poor generalization. If the batch size is too large, it may result in the model being unable to fit into memory, slowing down the training process, and potentially leading to poor generalization. The default batch size in ZEN is 64, but it is advisable to experiment with smaller sizes, such as 32 or 16, if memory errors occur.

### Window size:

Given a pixel to be masked", the "window size" parameter determines the size of the surrounding area to sample replacement pixel. Specifically, N2V divides the input image into overlapping patches of a fixed size (determined by the window size parameter) and trains a neural network to predict the central pixel of each patch based on the other pixels in the patch. During inference (denoising), N2V processes the input image in a sliding-window fashion, applying the trained neural network to each patch in turn to produce a denoised output image. If the window size is too small, it may not capture enough information to properly denoise the image. If the window size is too large, it may include too much information, leading to overfitting, increased computation time, and reduced performance. The default window size of 5 is optimal for most images. 

### Masking Ratio:

The "masking ratio" parameter determines the proportion of pixels within each patch that are randomly masked during N2V training. The best denoising performance is achieved by using sampling replacement pixels from the areas surrounding the masked pixels (not by replacing the masked pixel with zero) and N2V forces the neural network to learn a more robust representation of the underlying image structure, rather than simply memorizing the specific noise patterns in the input image. The masking ratio controls the level of noise injection during training, with higher values leading to more aggressive masking and generally better performance on noisy datasets. If the masking ratio is too small, the model may not be able to learn the noise distribution effectively, which can lead to poor denoising performance.
In general, the optimal values for these parameters will depend on the specific characteristics of the input image and the amount and type of noise present in the data. It is often necessary to experiment with different values to determine the best combination for a given task.


***

## Remarks and pitfalls

- if training images show only one type of structure, but later the model is applied to images with totally different structures, the model might “hallucinate”

- the performance of any denoising approach should be assessed based on the final goal of the analysis pipeline

- denoised images can be used to obtain certain features of the image, such as a more robust segmentation or localization of objects that is usually the basis for subsequent intensity measurements

- the effect of denoising on the quantifiability of the pixel intensities is a matter of ongoing research

- be careful when using N2V or any other method that modifies pixel values when the final application is something like FRET or Ratiometric Imaging, where the conclusion may directly depend on the pixel counts
