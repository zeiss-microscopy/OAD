### **Explanation of the Workflow**

#### **1. Define and Load Wellplate**
- Start by defining the wellplate and its loading process.
- Load the wellplate into the **CellDiscoverer 7 system**.

#### **2. Define Wells and Experiment**
- Specify the wells to be used for acquisition.
- Define a **Multi-Channel Z-Stack Experiment**.

#### **3. Move to the First Well**
- Navigate to the first well and find the surface using **Definite Focus**.
- Run **Software Autofocus (SWAF)** to refine the focus.

#### **4. Modify and Execute Experiment**
- Use the Z-values from SWAF to adjust the Z-Stack experiment.
- Execute the experiment and store the resulting **CZI image data** using the well's ID.

#### **5. Start Aging**
- Return to the experiment definition step for aging or further iterations.
