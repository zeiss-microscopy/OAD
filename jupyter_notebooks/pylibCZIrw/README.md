# Read, process and write CZIs using pylibCZIrw

This package provides a simple and easy-to-use Python wrapper for [libCZI] - a cross-platform C++ library to read and write multi-dimensional CZI image documents.

- The core concept of pylibCZIrw is focussing on reading and writing 2D image planes by specifying the dimension indices and its location in order to only read or write **what is really needed**.

The basic usage can be inferred from this sample notebook:&nbsp;
