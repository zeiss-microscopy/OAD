## Simple Viewing Images

Playing around with the Napari Viewer is fun. This example illustrates how to add wto widgets to the viewer.

* 1st widget can be:
  * **FileBrowser** --> Clicking on File will automatically open it inside the Viewer. The selected file is highlighted in green.
  * **TreeView** --> Clicking on a file will open it inside the Viewer
* 2nd widget is a table view, which displays some metadata of the current image

Disclaimer: This a prototype and just meant to be an example. Use at your own risk!

## Start a ZEN experiment from the Napari viewer

The Napari viewer allows to add even more interesting widgets. As a "fun project" it is possible to start a ZEN experiment from with Napari by sending ZEN python commands over TCP-IP.

For more information about controlling see: [ZEN Blue - TCP-IP Interface](https://github.com/zeiss-microscopy/OAD/tree/master/Interfaces/TCP-IP_interface)

In order to start an experiment from Napari there are a few new widgets:

* Selector for ZEN Experiments (*.czexp)
* Button **Run Experiment** to actually start a pre-configured in ZEN Blue
* Option to open an newly acquired CZI directly after the experiment is finished
